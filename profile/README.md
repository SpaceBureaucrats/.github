## Space Bureaucrats

**2025.12.31**
<br><br>
Our path is harder than ever, we don't have what many others have, but this only makes us stronger, the most important thing is not fall under the great pressure and escape checkmate position. We believe in a bright future while serving our cause, because nothing is easy and free.
<br>
Many people see one thing, but they are not aware of what is actually happening. _One day I will be able to tell way more about my story_.
<br><br>
This is not just organization, its equal to the life style itself. Its not about fighting with others over popularity or anything else, its about fighting yourself, each day rethinking who you actually are.
<br>
Life is unfair, but also it is very unexpected, where each day could happen anything, value your time and use it as it would be your last hour.
<br><br>
I hope we will achieve success, where during our long and hard path, we will meet a lot of great people, who will become our friends, closest mates, or a person who you will live for rest of your life and die together; And I am not just talking about work, this includes our simple life. _I send my regards to 4 of them, the most important one, who helped me this year whether it was moraly, physicly or they helped straighten my path and remember who I actually am_.
<br>
Don't be silent, talk. Loneliness kills you from inside.
<br><br>
Everything is possible.
